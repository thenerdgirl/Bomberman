# Bomberman

I finished the project in the fall of 2016 in my freshman year of college. At Rose-Hulman, one of the first CSSE classes you take as a CS (Computer Science) or SE (Software Engineering) major is CSSE220, or Object-Oriented Software Development. In this class, we learn a language called Java, and we learn about concepts such as types, 2-D arrays, objects, and multithreading. 

This project is a spin on the classic arcade game Bomberman. In this version, the hero (a professor named Buffalo) blows up colorful bricks to find food-related power ups to defeat the various monsters (one of which includes our very own professor Aaron Wilkin). After defeating all the monsters in the level, the hero can blow up all the colorful bricks in order to find the gateway to the next level.

Instructions will pop up once you open hthe game. Downloading an IDE such as Eclipse is recommended. Enjoy playing!
