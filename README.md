# Bomberman

I finished the project in the fall of 2016 in my freshman year of college. At Rose-Hulman, one of the first CSSE classes you take as a CS (Computer Science) or SE (Software Engineering) major is CSSE220, or Object-Oriented Software Development. In this class, we learn a language called Java, and we learn about concepts such as types, 2-D arrays, objects, and multithreading. 

This project is a spin on the classic arcade game Bomberman. In this version, the hero (a professor named Buffalo) blows up colorful bricks to find food and buffalo-related power ups to defeat the various monsters.
